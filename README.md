# 3ButtonController
Codebase for the Expat Audio 3ButtonController board.

That board uses an MSP430F2001.
The code in this main.c uses the flash memory on the chip to store values every time it's pressed.

The txt file in this folder is also a TI-TXT file that can be directly programmed to a device using MSP430Flasher or The Elpotronic tool.
